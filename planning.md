# Idea
- Another idea is if we do website for download link for cli app
- THIS IS A PROTOTYPE: in the future we can include a private repo access (with a secure website), make it easier for the user (don't have to input files, or folder stuff... could do a CLI app)
- for now though, its a website

# Specifics
- Needs to be a public repo
- Put repo link and then pass in their folder. From this, we show which ones are in the github and give checkboxes for extra files. Also, add a place for any extra files.
